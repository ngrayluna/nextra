# Weights & Biases

Weights & Biases is the machine learning platform for developers to build better models faster. Use W&B's lightweight, interoperable tools to quickly track experiments, version and iterate on datasets, evaluate model performance, reproduce models, visualize results and spot regressions, and share findings with colleagues.
Set up W&B in 5 minutes, then quickly iterate on your machine learning pipeline with the confidence that your datasets and models are tracked and versioned in a reliable system of record.

## Guides

1. [Experiment Tracking](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track): Visualize experiments in real time
2. [Hyperparameter Tuning](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps): Optimize models quickly
3. [Data and Model Versioning](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts): Version datasets and models
4. [Manage Models](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/models): Manage the model lifecycle from training to production
5. [Visualize Data](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/data-vis): Visualize predictions across model versions

## What is this?
This is a preview of what the Weights & Biases documentation website could look like if we use Nextra out of the box. **Nextra** is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) based static site generator. For more information about Nextra, see the [Nextra documentation](https://nextra.vercel.app/).

Nextra supports Markdown and React components ([MDX](/features/mdx)), automatically generated [sidebar and anchor links](/get-started#sidebar-and-anchor-links), file-system based routing, built-in syntax highlighting, image optimization, custom layouts, i18n, and all the features you love about Next.js.
